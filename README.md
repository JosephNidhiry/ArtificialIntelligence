Joseph Nidhiry's Artificial Intelligence Research Topics

The main purpose of this repository is to fulfil my passion of Learning and Teaching the subject of Artificial Intelligence and application of the same to real world use cases. It will start with a training session I had recently led on Facebook Live to help train NHS and Healthcare professionals in the use of AI. This will be expanded to more domains over the courtse of time
